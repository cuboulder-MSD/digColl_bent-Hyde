Mitchell's camps, and sent it to Bent to get him to mark the Indian camp at the time of Mitchell's march. He seems to have been in doubt and did not mark the camp but told me they were on Cherry Cr, and he seemed in doubt as to where Cherry creek really was. I think it was on the S. Fork Republican where he usually marks it, but that the Indians had left that camp and moved north to White Butte Cr, and this was how Mitchell's cavalry failed to find the hostile camp. He says they were on Cherry Cr when they burnt Julesberg and a few days later moved north to White Butte Cr. Mitchell left the Platte after the burning of Julesberg, and that makes if very probable the Indians were on White Butte when he combed the Republican for them. Bent has marked on this map Bitter Lake cr on Medicine Lake Cr. I think this is where the Cheyenne fight with Sumner occurred, 1857--no: that was a place of the same name but on the Solomon. He also marks where the Delawares were killed in 1844 names of Sappa and Beaver Crs. This is v. important. Write Bent again. This does not clear it up, as he marks Cherry Creek, where the big camp was, at a dif. place on another map--he on that map makes it a small n. trib. of the S. Republican, that location would explain why Mitchell missed the Indians, but on the other hand it would make the Indian march from camp to Julesberg about 100 ms. (Doesn't Bent say that the march took two days?) If Cherry cr was where he marks it on this map, how did Mitchell miss the camp on that cr?

Here for the occasion will be oldtimers, descendants of pio-neers, state, county and city of¬ficials and representatives of various historical organizations throughout the state. Site of the main ceremonies will be Fort Caspar which was rebuilt in 1938 on its original lo-cation. Guests of honor will include Miss Michele.Ann Portwood, an Arapaho from Riverton, Wyo. who holds the title Miss Indian America. Also taking part in the ceremonies will be units of the 3rd Howitzer Battalion, Headquarters Battery, Wyoming National Guard, and Indian dancers from the Arapahoe and Shoshone tribes of Riverton. Paul Henderson, historian for the Wyoming Parks Com-mission, will speak on frontier forts and points of interest on the Oregon Trail. An expansive diorama depict-ing the Indian battle being com-memorated will be dedicated by the Fort Caspar Commis¬sion. It was created in Denver by artist Juan Menchaca who is noted for his work with the Colorado State Historical Soci-ety and other historical organi-zations in the West, The battle occurred July 26, 1865, when a band of about 3,000 Sioux, Cheyennes and Arapahoes threatened a wagon train near Willow Springs about 17 miles from the North Platte River Crossing guarded by Fort Caspar. Lt. Caspar Collins, a cavalry officer, was sent with 25 men to the relief of the wagon train un-der Sgt. Amos J. Custard. The strength of the Indian band was unknown until they attacked. Collins was killed as he rode in¬to the attack head-on to save a fallen comrade. Casper was named in his honor, but in handling the name in Washington, it was misspelled by a postal clerk and the city has been known as Casper instead of Caspar as in-tended.

I got up at daylight to go out to where our ponies were left in the evening by my bro-in-law, Tomahawk. He told me where he had left them and said they would not go very far from there. It took me a little while to dress up. I started across the creek but when I got up on the hill I met Knig Fisher running back toward the camp. He told me a lot of white men were driving off the herds and as he spoke I looked toward Ft Lyon Trail, south of the village, and saw a long black line moving toward us. Then I knew soldiers were coming to attack the village. I ran back to the village as fast as I could and found the people all fleeing up the creek. A good many of the men did not leave until the soldiers entered the camp. I ran past Black K's lodge and saw he had a flag up, tied to a lodge-pole, and he was holding it. I ran to our lodge where I found my bonnet, shield and quiver of arrows all ready. My father Bear Tongue had just been making a lot of arms to me. I had taken my pistol with me when I went out after the ponies and now I took my other weapons. By this time soldiers were shooting at everybody, and while I was putting on my war-bonnet and taking my weapons bullets were hitting the lodge like hail-stones When I left the lodge I ran behind the lodge so the troops could not get good shots at me. When I got to the creek bank I saw Big Head, Crow Neck, Cut-lip-bear and Smoke standing behind the bank, so I joined them. At first the soldiers fired at us, the mounted and followed the main body of Indian up the creek. We were in the west end of the village, not over 100 yrds from the lodges; the cr ran north of the village at this point and the people were running up it toward the north. The soldiers had come from s of the village. We ran across the cr toward a b high bank; but when we reached it soldiers came upon us us again, from all sides. Big Head and the others continued to run west, but I, seeing the main party of people going north, went in that direction with about 20 soldiers after me. Big Head and all s his party crossed the hill and ran into a large party of troops and were all killed. About 2 ms up the cr I came where the people were, with breastworks thrown up on the bed of the cr. On the way here the feathers of my bonnet were and several shots went thro my shield, but I was not hit. On the way I saw many women and children, dead and dying. They soldiers had not scalped them yet. After the fight I saw 2 or 3 soldiers together, standing over the dead as tho they were scalping them, and I saw an old woman who had been scalped and was walking., around, but could not see where to go. All her hair had been cut off. After we got into the holes not many of us were killed, but all who did not reach the hole were killed.",Cheyenne Indians--History--Sources,descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85023188,,,,,"Cheyenne Indians--Wars, 1864",descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85023191,Colorado--History--To 1876,descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85028671,Indians of North America--Colorado,descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85065447,"Sand Creek Massacre, Colo., 1864",descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85117184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Typewritten document of Little Bear's Statement, Sand Creek, April 14",reports,aat,300027267,,,,,University of Colorado at Boulder Libraries.

E. Hyde 3019 Burdette St. Omaha, Neb. LAST OF COL. BENT'S SONS DEAD George Bent Dies Among the Cheyennes. Had Many Adventures. George Bent, the last surviving son of Colonel William Bent, of Bent's Old fort, died among the Cheyenne Indians at Colony, Oklahoma, on May 19, 1918. George Bent was the most famous of the Bent boys and was widely known and very much hated in Colorado during the Civil War. George Bent was born at Bent's old Fort, near the present town of Las Animas, Colorado, July 7, 1843. His mother was Owl Woman, daughter of Grey Thunder, the most important man among the Southern Cheyennes. Bent's childhood was spent at the old trading-post and in the, camps of the Cheyennes. He had many adventures, beginning with his escape from the cholera in 1849, when he was six years old. On that occasion he was in a large Indian camp on Bluff Creek, south of where Dodge City, Kansas, now stands. He was with his step-mother, Yellow Woman, his grandmother and his baby brother Charlie. When the cholera broke out the Indiansseveral thousand of themstampeded in every direction, the cholera striking them down as they fled. Yellow Woman put George and baby Charlie into a travels or pole-drag, drawn by a big mile and with the old grandmother fled to the Cimarron river with a band of Cheyennes and Arapahoes. No sooner had the Indians set up their tepees when the cholera began killing people in the camp, and the Indians fled again, traveling all night through the sand hills. Bent's grandmother died on this march. When they reached the Arkansas, the Indians met another band of Cheyennes fleeing southward with the cholera raging among them. Yellow Woman then took the two children and fled up the Arkansas to Bent's Fort, where they arrived safe but worn out. Old people used to say half the Cheyenne tribe died of cholera that summer. The Indians were afraid to camp together, but broke up into little family groups and hid themselves in out-of-the-way places. When George Bent was nine years old his father blew up the old fort and moved down the Arkansas to the Big Timbers. George remembered this event very well, and used to say that his father said on the morning when he blew up the fort that he did not care to live in the post any longerall his brothers and his first wife had died there and it made him sad to live in the old rooms. In the following spring, 1853, Col. Bent took his children to Missouri and put them to school at Westport (now Kansas City, Mo.) where he had a fine farm. He then went back to Colorado and built Bent's New Fort at the Big Timbers. George Bent went to school at Westport until '57 and then to an academy in St. Louis, where he remained, till '61. When he went home for vacation in spring, 1861, he found all western Missouri taking up arms for the South. All the boys were enlisting in the state troops, as they were called. These regiments were really intended for the Confederate service. Young Bent enlisted in Col. Greene's cavalry regiment and was in the battles of Wilson's Creek and Pea Ridge. During the retreat from Corinth, he was captured by Union cavalry and while being marched through the streets of St. Louis with other prisoners he was recognised by a boy he had known at the academy. Robert Bent happened to be in the city, buying Indian trade-goods, and on learning of his brother's capture he went to Robert Campbell, from whom the Bents always bought their Indian goods; Campbell went to see General Fremont, who was also a friend of Colonel Bent, and the result was that George was released on parole with the understanding that he should return home with Robert and take no further part in the war. He reached Colorado in the fall of 1862 and lived for some months at his father's stockade and trading-post on the south side of the Arkansas near the mouth of the Purgatoire River. The Colorado men however; had no use for ex-rebels, and they made life so interesting for young Bent that in the spring of '63 he left his father's stockade and went to live among the Cheyennes, where his younger half-brother Charlie was already living. Charlie had returned to Colorado in the fall of '61. Little is known of his movements, and George Bent never would say much about him even to his best friends. George Bent spent the year '65 in hunting buffalo and visiting his Indian relations in various Cheyenne camps. In the following spring, 1864, an Indian war broke out in Colorado. Bent always claimed the whites started the war by harrying the Cheyennes and Arapahoes. However this may be, as soon as the war began Black Kettle led the friendly Cheyennes and Arapahoes south of the Arkansas, to be out of the way of the troops, and George Bent went with him. In Colorado . It was generally stated that Georgia Bent was leading the Cheyenne raiding parties, but this story had no foundation. Bent was in the hostile camp later in the summer, but he did not take any part in the raids. In the fall he wrote a letter for Black Kettle and other chiefs proposing a peace council and this letter was sent in to Fort Lyon and resulted in Major Wynkoop of the First Colorado Cavalry going out to the Indian camp and bringing the chiefs with him to Denver. The chiefs returned from his visit with an impression that peace was soon to be made, and Black Kettle went in with his band and camped on Sand Greek, near Ft. Lyon. Here, in November, Col, Chivington with the colorado cavalry regiments surprised the Indians in camp and killed over one hundred of them. Bent was badly wounded in the thigh, but fought through the whole engagement and got away on a pony one of his Indian cousins gave him. His own herd of ponies was captured by the Colorado men. From a Cheyenne camp on the Smoky Hill River, young Bent slipped down to the Arkansas and reached his father's stockade, where he remained in hiding until his wound had healed a bit. His father told him he could not stay at his place, as his life would not be safe there, so Bent rejoined the Indians as soon as he was a little better. Before the Sand Greek fight the Indians had been settled down in their winter camps, in many small bands; but after the Chivington attack all of the Cheyennes, Arapahoes and Sioux came together in a great camp on the upper Republican, on the Kansas-Colorado border line. Black Kettle was still urging peace, but the Indians were very angry and would not listen to him. Black Kettle was a pacifist, even after Sand Creek, and reaped the pacifist's reward, for in '68 Col. Custer surprised his camp while the chief was engaged in another peace movement, and this time Black Kettle did not escape. When George Bent rejoined the Indians they were preparing for a grand raid on Julesburg, on the South Platte. One thousand warriors took part in this affair and young Bent went with them. He always claimed this was the first Indian raid he was ever in. The Indians set a trap for the cavalry stationed near Julesburg, but the trap was sprung too soon and most of the soldiers got back to their stockade. The Indians then looted Julesburg stage-station, the stage company's ware-house, grainery and store. They had brought women and extra ponies with then and took hundreds of loads of shelled corn, groceries and canned goods back to the Indian camp. In this raid George Bent found a cavalry major's uniform in the express office at Julesburg. He wore this uniform in several fights up north the following summer. After the first Julesburg raid the Indians decided to move north, clean out the Overland Stage line and join Red Cloud and the northern Cheyennes up on Powder River. They started this march early in February, 1865, during bitter cold weather. The main body with the village, the women and children, moved due north and struck the stage road west of Julesburg near Harlow's Ranch. Here they camped on the north bank of the South Platte, the tepees of the great village extending some miles along the river. At the same time a large party of Cheyennes moving northwest struck the road near Valley, Colorado, and broke up all travel, burning stations and ranches, attacking coaches and wagon-trains and running off herds of cattle and oxen. George Bent was with this party. A large party of Sioux moving northeast struck the road below Julesburg and carried out a similar raid in that region. For a week the Indians remained encamped on the South Platte, keeping the road blocked. They broke the telegraph line and cut Denver off from the east. Three large wagon-trains loaded with groceries and other supplies for Denver had been captured by the Indians, and their camp was full of goods of all kinds. Bent was fond of telling how the Indians brought strange articles to him to ask him what they were and how they were used. The canned goods puzzled them greatly, but they soon learned to chop the cans open with their tomahawks and eat the contents. It was some time, however, before they would eat the canned oysters. One old man brought Bent and box to ask him what it contained, and it was filled with fine candied citron. ""Scalp-dances were going on in this big Indian camp day and night,"" Bent said. At night the camp had many big fires in it, around which the dancers gathered, the drums going all night long. When I was out with the raiders at night and we lost our way in the dark, we used to halt and look for the camp to find our direction. You could see the glow of the fires on the sky a long way off, and if anything hid the fires from us we would listen for the drums. On a still night you could heard them beating miles away up the valley. ""During these raids along the Platte a Cheyenne war party ran into a party of white men going east and killed them all. These men were ex-soldiers of the Third Colorado regiment, ""hundred days men,"" who had cut up the Cheyennes at Sand Creek. There were eleven of them and the Indians killed them all. In their bagage were many things taken from the Cheyenne camp on Sand Creek and the scalps of two young Cheyennes. These scalps were recognized by the Cheyennes, one by the peculiar ""color of the hair and the other by a little shell ornament which was still attached to the scalp-lock."" ""At this time the Indians went down and raided Julesburg again. This time the soldiers did not come out of their stockade, though the Indians rode up close. I counted outside the stockade the graves of eighteen men killed by the Indians in the first raid on Julesburg. The Indians plundered Julesburg completely this time, and then set fire to the buildings, burning them one by one in the hope of tempting the soldiers out to fight, but there was only, one company at the stockade and the officers kept the men inside, shelling us with their howitzers."" From this camp the Indians moved northward before the cavalry could gather in force enough to attack them. They ran into a cavalry column from Ft. Laramie on the North Platte and had a two days' fight with the troops. Col. Collins of the 11th Ohio Cavalry was in command. He corralled his wagons, dug rifle-pits and fought the Indians off. Bent always said they did not get much change out of this officer. From the North Platte the Indians made a hard march up to the Black Hills, then turned west and joined Bed Cloud and the northern Indians on Powder River. In the spring of 1865 small raiding parties began attacking the Platte road. The chiefs told the young men to examine the road and report the best point for a grand attack in midsummer. The young men reported old Platte Bridge, near the present Casper, Wyoming, as the best place, and in July one thousand Cheyenne, Arapaho and Sioux warriors set out to attack this place. Bent went along and used to tell the story in great detail to his friends. The Indians hid behind the hills on the north side of the river and sent a small party of warriors out into the valley, to draw the cavalry into a trap. Charlie Bent was with these warriors. The troops left their stockade at the southern end of the bridge end came across to the north bank after these Indians, but the officers seemed very cautious and refused to be drawn into the hills. They stopped near the bridge and fired a howitzer at the Indians, then returned across the bridge. The next day the Indians tried again, sending a small party down toward the bridge to tempt the troops into the hills. A company of cavalry crossed the bridge, but instead of pursuing the Indians turned west up the road, to meet a wagon-train that was expected from the west. After they had marched a mile the warriors hiding behind the hills suddenly charged down into the valley. They came in a great swarm from every direction, and the cavalry started back to¬ward the bridge at a gallop. Before they could reach the bridge the Indians ran into them from front, flank and rear. The cavalry attempted to cut their way through the mass of Indians; in the meantime more soldiers had left the stockade and rushed out on the bridge. They had a howitzer and opened a rapid fire on the Indians, who were still swarming out of the hills to join in the fight. A few of the cavalrymen cut their way out and reached the bridge, but practically the whole company was annihilated. ""When I charged up to the road,"" George Bent used to say, ""everything was covered with a dense cloud of dust and powder smoke. I saw an officer rushing by me. His horse was running away with him end an arrow was sticking in his forehead. He fell a little farther along the road. A Cheyenne got his horse and had it for some months in the Indian camp. It was a hard-mouthed horse, always running away."" This officer was Lieutenant Casper Collins, for whom the town of Casper was later named. Soon after the cavalrymen had all been killed, Indians up on the hills began signalling with their blankets, ""More enemies, up the river,"" All the warriors in the valley turned up the river, riding hard. They found another party of soldiers, with a wagon-train. .These men had corralled the train in a hollow on the river bank and were ready for a fight when the Indians came up. The Indians fought them for some time, and just as Bent came up the warriors made a mounted charge broke into the corral of wagons and billed all the troopers. One soldier, or a teamster, escaped by swimming the platte. He had his six-shooter buckled around his head. A Cheyenne swam- after him, but the white man reached the opposite bank first and taking his revolver from around his head shot the Indian dead and ran into the bushes. He got away. In August, General Connor led a cavalry column to Powder River and had some fights with the Indians. He says in his report that one of his officers had a talk under a flag of truce with the Indians, and one of the Bent boys (evidently Charlie) was present. This young fellow told the officer that the Indians were still very mad about the Sand Creek affair and would make peace only on condition that Col. Chivington should be tried and hung. In the fall of 1865 George Bent returned south with the Cheyennes. They raided the Overland Stage road on the Platte and also attempted to break up the new stage line to Denver, up the Smoky Hill river, but the stage-stations on the new line were mostly ""dug-outs"" built in the form of a cellar with an earth covered roof rising only a foot or two above the ground; loop-holes had been cut under the eaves on the level of the ground and the station-hands standing inside fired out at the raiders. The Cheyennes did their best, but they could neither kill the men nor burn the buildings, and at length they drew off and went south of the Arkansas. Here they learned that Black Kettle had signed a peace some months earlier. George Bent did not see any further fighting. There was peace in 1865, and when a new Cheyenne war broke out in '67 he was living with Black Kettle who was, as usual, friendly. In the summer Col. Jesse Leavenworth, the Indian agent, hired Bent to go out and bring in all the chiefs for a peace council. Bent went all over the plains, visiting the camps and persuading the chiefs to come to the council, which was later held on Medicine Lodge Creek, where a general peace was signed. In that year, 1867, Bent married Black Kettle's niece, Magpie, and in the following year he took his wife to Colorado where he visited his father in the old stockade on the Purgatoire. At that time Kit Carson was very ill at Boggs' place near the month of the Purgatoire. Carson in fact had but a few days longer to live. He was very much depressed and out of money. Someone told George Bent that Carson had a fine horse he wished to sell and Bent went to Boggs' place with Judge Moore (who had married Mary Bent, George's sister) and bought the horse from Garson*. This was the horse Carson rode in the battle of Adobe Fort in 1864. Bent used the animal as a racing-pony, but a year or so later it strayed from the Indian herd and was caught by the soldiers who sold it to an officer's wife, Mrs. Roe. In her book, ""The Letters of an Officer's Wife,"" Mrs. Roe tells of the horse and of its death some months later. From 1869, when the Cheyenne agency was established, George Bent served the government as interpreter and clerk in the agency office, holding the latter position until the time of his death. The cause of his death was Bright's disease, from which he had been suffering for many years. Bent was recognised as the best authority on the history of the Cheyenne tribe and he did much work for men who were engaged in writing about the Indians. George Bent leaves a widow, a son named William Bent, who lives among the Souix up north, two daughters, living among the Cheyennes in Oklahoma, and several grand-children. Among the Indians George Bent was always called ""Texan"" because he had been in the Confederate army. ""Tejanoi"" is the Cheyenne form of this word; it means a Southerner, though literally it means Texanthe Indians thinking all Southerners came from Texas. Omaha, Nov. 19 / 1918. The Editor, Rooky Mountain News, Denver, Colo. Dear Sir: I wrote the enclosed article for you at the time of George Bent's death, hut on sending it in, you informed me that the great press of material on the war made it im¬possible for you to use my article. As I understand the stream of material on the war has now let up a little, I thought I would take a chance and submit this article to you once more. The little picture is not very clear, but might serve as the basis for a good drawing. This is the only photo George Bent ever had taken when a young man, and the original when I saw it and made a Kodak copy some years ago, was very yellow and faded, covered with spots and tack~holes. Sincerely yours, Geo. E Hyde 3019 Burdette St. Mr. FarrarI am a persistent cuss, but if you don't want this stuff this time I shan't bother you by submitting it again. Just making a Last Try.

Bent's first stockade, built in 1824 (or 1826?) was on the north bank of the river above Pueblo. Some say twenty miles above Fountain River. Pikes stockade, or redoubt, built in the winter of 1806-1807, was on the south side of the Arkansas about opposite the mouth of the Fountain River. Pueblo, was established in 1843 on the west side of Fountain River and the north bank of the Arkansas. On Map No. 3 which accompanies the volume of Calhoun's Correspondence, this place is set down as ""Pueblo de San Carlos."" Fountain River, was called Boiling River by the Cheyennes (E esivut iyohe). The old Mountain Trail from the Platte came down the valley of this stream, crossed the river at Pueblo, and went on south to Taos. There seem to have been many branches of this trail. One passed south via the San Carlos and Greenhorn, joining the old Ute trail. From the upper valley of Fountain River a trail struck westward into the South Park. This was the war trail of the Utes, Cheyennes, and Arapahos. Gant and Blackwell's post, built in 1832, abandoned before 1835, was on the north bank of the Arkansas about six miles below Fountain River. (See Colonel Henry Dodge's report, 1835). Rio San Carlos, or Rio Don Carlos, as it was sometimes termed in early days (as in the original Spanish land grant) comes in from the south, about opposite Gant and Blackwell's post. The eastern branch of this stream is the Greenhorn, named for the famous Comanche chief, Cuernoverde, who thrived early in the 18th century. Black Squirrel Creek, comes in from the north, about 10 miles below the San Carlos. The stream is sometimes called Chico, a name also given to another creek on the south side of the river at this place. A trail led up Black Squirrel Creek, across the divide and down Cherry Creek to the South Platte. The name Black Squirrel Creek dates from the early '40's, but no clue is given as to how the name originated. This stream seems to be the one that is marked on Lieutenant Parke's map (No. 3 in the Calhoun Correspondence) as ""Sage Creek."" Apache Creek, comes in from the south, a little above Black Squirrel Creek. Called Apache Creek in Sage (1843), today usually set down as Chico Creek. Booneville, established by Col. A.G. Boone, a son or nephew of Daniel Boone and a close friend of William Bent, stood on the north bank of the Arkansas, about six miles below Black Squirrel Creek. The place became a stage station during the Civil War, but did not grow and seems to have been abandoned soon after the war. Booneville is shown on the Wheeler survey map No. 62 A. Wolf's Den Creek, so called in Sage, 1843, comes in from the north, about 10 miles below Black Squirrel Creek and about opposite the mouth of the Rio Huerfano. This stream is now known as Haynes' Creek, probably named after Mr. Haynes who had the contract for building the Cheyenne and Arapaho agency at Point-of-Rock in 1864. Rio Huerfano, (often prnounced 'Wolfano' by the American trappers and traders) comes in from the south about opposite Wolf's Den or Haynes' Creek. The Cheyennes called it the Huerfano 'Old Lodge-skin Creek' because of a butte near the creek which from a distance resembled an old dilapidated Indian lodge. (Information of George Bent May 3, 1917). Pawnee Hills, was the name given by the Cheyennes to the bluffs along the north side of the Arkansas, opposite the mouth of the Huerfano. Here about 1833 the Cheyennes and Arapahos attacked and exterminated a large war party of Pawnees. Leaving the South Platte near where Denver now stands, a trail struck up Cherry Creek, across the ridge, down Black Squirrel Creek, crossed the Arkansas near the mouth of the Huerfano and then ran due south, across the head of the Apishapa, joining the Bent's Fort Trail in the upper valley of the Purgatory. This trail is marked on the map accompanying Chi tenden's Fur Trade. It is mentioned by Sage, Fremont, and other early travelers. Old Fort Reynolds, stood on the south bank of the Arkansas a little above the mouth of the Huerfano. It is shown on the Wheeler map No. 52 A, and is mentioned in some old books; but when it was built and when abandoned we do not know. Camp Fillmore, stood on the north bank of the Arkansas, 10 miles below Booneville. It was garrisoned by Colorado cavalry during the Civil War and also used as a stage station. Apishapa Creek, comes in from the south about 20 miles below the Huerfano. This stream was called 'Quarelling Creek' by the Cheyennes. ""Many years ago a village of Indians encamped there began to quarrel among themselves. Both men and women took part in the dispute. They did not fight; merely talked at each otherscolded."" George Bent states that this was a Cheyenne village and that the quarrel arose durijg the selection of young chiefs to take the place of the old ones.",Cheyenne Indians--History--Sources,descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85023188,,,,,"Cheyenne Indians--Wars, 1864",descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85023191,Arkansas River -- Maps,geographicPlace,lcsh,sh 85007212,Colorado--History--To 1876 -- Maps,descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85028671,Indians of North America--Colorado,descriptiveTopic,lcsh,sh 85065447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Typewritten statement concerning locations and distances in the Upper Arkansas Region.,notes,aat,300027200,,,,,University of Colorado at Boulder Libraries.

Note --I told Geo. Bent about this army officer's wife and her book, and how she says the soldiers got hold of a fine Indian race horse and gave it to her, and she found out later it belonged to a half-breed named Bent. He says in his last letter this horse is the very one he told me above some years ago: the fine running and buffalo horses be bought from Carson at Bogg's ranch, when he was up there just a short time before Carson's death. The trouble with these notes from Beckwith and Gunnison, is that the distances given are from their camps, and it is almost impossible to locate their camps, which makes the distance useless. However: we know the exact location of the Bent's Log Houses, on the site of Old Ft. Lyon and 1 mile west of Bent's New Fort, Now, these men camped 1 mile below the Log Houses, therefore their camp was on the site of Bent's New Fort They place the upper end of the Big Timbers 12 ms above the log houses and 13 l/4 ms below Purgatoire, making 25 1/4 ms from the log houses to Purgatoire. They say that in this time, 1853, the Big Timbers were 24 ms long; since the upper end was 12 ms, above the Log Houses, the lower end of the timbers was also 12 ms below the Log House. , or about opposite the town of Lamar, 3ent usually speaks of these tibers as 5 ms. long; a military report dated 1864 says the timbers were completely cut and all gone at that date, Camp 28 was at Bent's New Fort site Leaving camp they note the log houses, at this point they say the sandstone bluffs come quite to the river. One of these bluffs of a knob was the place were Bed Shin, the Cheyenne Ajax climbed up and with a load of arrows and six or seven butcher knifes,, defied the whole world. Reacted upper end of B. Timbers at 13 ms from camp, 13 ms above B. s New Fort; here again the bluffs approached the river. Going back one day: their Camp 27 was 20.28 ms below Camp 28 and therefore that distance below B.s New Fort It was therefore within 2 or 3 ms of Sand Cr, east or west of that stream. They state they left this carmp and crossed 3 ms of heavy sand, struck clav soil, and at 7 ms reached lower end B. Timbers. Speaks of island in the river. Going back another day, their camp 26 was 21.87 ms. below Camp 27. At 15 ms they struck a bottom with salt on the surface. Salicornia growing abundantly on the bottoms; bluffs gentle and sloping. They must have camped near Sand Creek, but do not mention it. Going back still another day: their Camp 25 was 24.58 ms above camp 26. Mention no features this day, camped on a dry creek, evidently Wild Horse cr Bent's Log Houses, 1852-3. 12 ms below upper end B. Ts according to Beckwith . That wouod be abt 2 ms below New Fort. 3 ms below New Fort is cor on all my maps. Beckwith also says ""13 ms above lower end B. Ts, and lower end B. Ts apparent'y 7 ms above Sand Cr, making Log Houses just 20 ms above Sand Cr, which is just where Bent puts the New Fort, but his dist. is wrong -- too long. The trouble with Beckwith is he says the bluffs at the Log Houses com ""quite to the river"" while if his dists are right the Houses were midway btw Lamar and Prowers, opp an island, and no bluffs come down to the river here. Lower end B. Ts I cannot locate on my maps from Beckwith. He says it was 12 to 15 ms below Log Houses which would measure on any map almost to Sand Cr. Measuring the other way -- west --he says left camp, evidently at mouth and Cr and marched 7 ms to lower end B. Ts. That would put the lower end just below Lamar, but Would make his location of the upper end too far up, if his dist of 24 ms length is cor. Latest distances -- May 14, 1917. Bent's Old Fort. Site is known. Purgatoire. Bent says 13 -- wrong. Bent's Ranch, 1/2 m. west of Purgat. and 100 yards s. of Ark. Boggs' ranch, 1 m. up purg. on w. bank, 1/2 m above Bent's. Upper end B.

Ts f ms, would bring us to mout Mud Cr. B. Ts 5 ms long, would bring us just to mouth Purgatoire!! On Wheeler map B.s N. Ft is just 10 ms below here Beckwith puts upper end B. Ts. Apaches stone bluff, just opp New Frt and 4 ms below Muddy Cr -- ent w Beckwith and Gunnison, 1853: their information compared with distances on Geol. Survey maps. Bent's Old Fort. They say it was 15 ms above Purgatoire. That is exactly right on the Wheeler map, measuring along the old road. Also on the Guide Book Sheep 9. Also on the Las Animas Sheet Upper end B. Timbers. 12 ms above B.s trading-houses, here the sandstone bluffs approach the river; road above here passes over spurs; camped 10.26 ms above Upper end B.T.s and 3 below Pugatoire, making upper end 13 1/4 ms below Purgatoire. 13 1/4 ms below Purg. on Wheeler map road would be just opp. Caddo Cr, or a little above, allowing for bends in the road. Same on Guide Book Sheet 9-8. Same on the Las Animas-Lamar Sheets. On Lamar She the road is shown ascending the bluffs just opp. south Caddoa Cr. The Upper End B. T.s was therefore 13 1/4 ms below mouth Purgatoire and just opp. Caddoa Cr. This is correct on all my maps. Bent's Trading houses, 1852-3. ""12 ms below upper end B. Ts."" here the bluffs come quite to the river; ""13 ms above lower end B.Ts"". B.Ts ""24 ms long"". 12 ms below upper end B. Ts would be 3 ms below B.s New Ft on Wheeler map. Same on Lamar Sheet, where a big island is shown 3 ms below B.s New Fort, and the Bent trading houses would be just opp. the middle of this island. These trading houses were therefore abt 3 ms below New Fort and just midway btw Prowers and Lamar towns. Lower end Big Timbers, ""24 ms below upper end""; ""14 ms below B.s trading houses. On guide Book sheet 24 ms from Caddoa Cr would bring you to mouth Sand Cr, which would make dist wrong. On Lamar sheet 24 ms below Caddoa Cr would bring you below Ckay Cr and nearly to Sand Cr. Sand Cr. mouth, by road ond Granda and Lamar sheets is 2 plus 23 1/2 ms or 25 1/2 ms bwlo Caddoa Cr. That would make B. Ts start 1 and 1/2 ms west of Sand Cr. Lower end B. Ts were therefore somewhere btw Morse and Lamar -- measuring down river these dists given seem to point to Morse, but measuring up to Lamar as lower end. That makes a difference of 6 ms to be accounted for ""14 ms below Bent's Bent's trading houses"" would also bring you near to Sand Cr. There is not a word in the journal to tell whether they camped on Sand Cr or below or above it, p.27. Soft, argellaceous yellowish limestone 90 ms above Ft. Atkinson. That would be near Syracuse, where the guide book shows slaby crecaceous limestone all along bluffs. Yes this eckwith geologist descs the Greenhorn limestone just as the geol guide book does it at Kendall, just below Syracuse , p43; it is soft and chalky and weathers yellow. This would be Camp 25, ""89 ms above Atkinson."" 30 ms farther is a row of low hills of a harder gray limestone. That would be near Holy or Granada. Guide says the Timpas limestone appears in low bluffs n of Granda; below here into kansas the valley shows few rocks. This is a little above Camp 26 which was on a dry creek 24 ms above Camp 25. Holly on Wild Horse Cr is just 30 ms above Kendall. Beckwith and Gunnison. Jul 27 ""A mile from camp we passed two or three log-houses, occupied as a trading station by Mr. Wm.

Columbine St, Denver, Colorado 80210 FOURTEEN ORIGINAL MAPS OP GEORGE BENT-GEORGE HYDE by Jean Afton What happened to the map George Bent drew of the Indian encampment and Chivington's attack trail at Sand Creek? This map described by George Hyde as drawn by Bent with the help of old Cheyennes who had been there, was declared lost by Savoie Lottinville who searched for it when editing the Hyde manuscript of the ""Life of George Bent"". A letter dated October, 1928, in the Western History Collections of The University of Colorado Libraries, states in part: ""I have just received the following lot: Map of Platte Bridge fight drawn on coarse paper in pencil by George Bent, half-breed son of Col. William Bent, showing positions of soldiers and Indians and locations of events in the fight. Map of Sand Creek battle-field on coarse paper in pencil by Bent showing positions of Indians and Chivington's trail before the massacre. Map of Sand Creek battle-field prepared by George Hyde with notations of places and names in ink on five sheets of letter-sized paper pasted together....u This letter addressed to Professor James F. Willard, head of the History Department at the University, was from a John VanMale, dealer in books on Colorado. VanMale concluded: ""With the maps are typewritten pages of explanation and comment by Hyde. You may have the lot for §30.00. If you don't take them my next list will be quite swell, but if you do, I'll have the $30.00, so either way I'll feel pleased."" On November 1, 1928, The University of Colorado receipted for $40.00 a list of six maps and other material. Four maps were drawn by Bent and two by Hyde with Bent notations. However, the collection now contains 14 maps, and the Western History Collections department of Norlin Library has no record of the accession of the additional eight maps. George Hyde may have included his work maps in the packet, considering them of little value. It may also account for the discrepancy between the selling and buying prices. Another letter from VanMale dated December 4, 1928, ended: ""The same chap who sold me the Bent material is sending me a collection of letters from Bent, which I shall bring to Boulder for you to see.... This chap doesn't want the letters printed for a few years though, as he still hopes to write or publish his life of Bent."" (University of Colorado Libraries, Western Historical Collection; Bent Maps). Even though Hyde was selling his letters and maps, he continued his search for a publisher for his manuscript on George Bent. In 1930, circumstances forced him to sell this manuscript, and The Denver Public Library bought it for a re-ported $300.00. Thirty eight years later it was edited and published by Savoie Lottinville as The Life of George Bent. The correspondence between Bent and Hyde began in 1904 and continued until Bent's death in 1918. Bent wrote several hundred letters during this time. The known collections of these letters belong to the Western History Department of the Denver Public Library; the Colorado State Historical Society Library; a small number to the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles. And 260, which Hyde sold to an Omaha dealer in 1926, now belong to the Coe Collection of Western Americana at Yale University. The University of Colorado has the maps and one Bent letter. Although researchers have used the maps from time to time, the records of the curator indicate that they have not been published. The major portion of this paper is devoted to those maps drawn or marked by Bent. However, I'll cover all of Hyde's maps and include his comments, where they are relevant, so those interested will know what the collection holds. Excerpts from Bent's letters describe in his own words the actions, events and localities depicted on the maps. I have made no changes in the spelling, punctuation or grammar of these letters. At times the meaning is somewhat obscure, but the letters indicate Bent's ability to describe the Indian position. Unless stated otherwise, all the letters quoted in this paper are from the Yale university collection and are identified by dates only. MAP# 1 FROM FT. ZARRAH ON THE GREAT BEND OF THE ARKANSAS RIVER TO 50 MILES EAST OF BENT'S FORT. Hyde's work maps Hyde; ""This old work map is not correct in some details.... Bent marked on this map in faint blue pencilmarks. 1. 'lodge pole trail' along the south bank of the Arkansas from Ft. Atkinson west into Colo. 2. on Bluff Cr. 'camp here I840', this is big camp of Cheyennes and Arapahos at time of their battle with Kiowas and Comanches, but the date is wrong-- should be 1838. 3. On Cimarron 'my Grandfather died'. This was his mother's father; the keeper of the Arrows and a very promenint man."" Actually the location is also wrong according to Bent's letter (Jan. 23, 1905). He wrote; ""In 1857 Kiowas, Comanches and Arapahos killed 42 Cheyennes on head of Washita River. These Cheyennes were out on war path----That is why Cheyennes and Arapahos moved against them (in 1838) when they had big fight on Wolf Creek. My Grandfather was killed there... According to Grinnell (American Anthropologist, 1906) Wolf Creek was the Indian name for the North Canadian--off this map. This map also shows a broken line for the trail and two camps of Dull Knife and his band of Northern Cheyennes going north in 1878, in their tragic flight from the Oklahoma Reservation. The authenticity of the Colorado University maps is proved by the blue pencil marks indicating the lodge-pole trail, and the red dash trail of Dull Knife drawn by Bent. MAP# 2 THE DRAINAGE OP THE ARKANSAS FROM WEST OF PUEBLO TO THA KANSAS LINE. HYDE: ""work map 1916--not accurate in all points."" Hyde referred to Rufus Sage, Scenes in the Rocky Mountains; and Lt. George M. Wheeler, leader of an expedition of the Corp of Army Engineers on ""Topographic Surveys West of the 100th Meridian"" during the years 1873-1684. Locations of posts, stockades and forts from Bent's letters: April 14, 1908; ""The first picket Fort they build was in 1827 on Arkansas River, at mouth of Huerfano-60-65 miles west of Fort William or Bent's Fort."" ""Bent's Old Fort built of adobe. Bent Bros started this fort in 1827 and finished in 1832."" ""Bent's New Fort built in 1853 entirely of stone."" ""Bent Bros built another post or fort at mouth of Fountain Creek, this called El Pueblo, but this fort was unimportant so they did not use it long."" April 10, 1905; ""01d Fort--12 miles above Purgatory River New Port--32 miles below Old Fort Gov't Stockade--1/2 mile above New Fort, called Ft Wise Gov't rented New Fort during; war, called Ft Wise, then changed to Ft. Lyon. Gov't build New Fort Lyon 16 miles above post on Arkansas, 4 miles below Purgatory."" Hyde marked the Indian trails from Bent's New Fort north to the Smoky Kill and south to the Cimarron. MAP # 3 GE0RGE BENT'S MAP OF THE ARKANSAS AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. Bent noted the Indian names for several creeks. Letter, May 3, 1917 (University of Colorado Collection) ""Huerfano Creek call by Indians Old Lodge Skin Creek. there is Peak near this Creek looks like Old Lodge. and this is way it is called. ""Apishapa Call by Indians Quarreling Creek long time ago there was big Village of Cheyennes in Camp. Chiefs in Selecting Young Chiefs in their places quarreled all Night. and this is way it is called Quarreling Creek."" Bent shows place where the Apaches buried their dead during the cholera outbreak in 1849. Called the ""Cramps"" by the Indians, cholera may have been brought onto the Plains by the '49ers headed for California. MAP # 4 HYDE'S MAP OF THE ARKANSAS AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. Drawn by George Hyde, this map was sent to Bent for labelling. He marked only 'Big Timbers' below Bent's stockade on the Purgatorie, Bitter and Black Lakes and the area where the Apaches buried their dead. MAP #5 KIOWA FIGHT IN 1831 or 1832. Letter, February 15, 1912; ""Just 72 years ago east of Denver Colo on what Cheyennes call Scout Creek is where the Cheyennes had fight with the Kiowas, it was this way. Cheyennes camped on Artichoke Creek, early next morning as it was custom those days, some men went ahead to locate Buffalo, several men that were ahead seen something away off that look like herd of buffalo or wild horses, but as ″ the sun rose higher most of these animals were white, and pretty soon they seen people on horses. At this time Cheyenne Village was on move. Cheyennes began to signal on their horses. One rode from his party away from and back to them several times. This was signal enemy ahead. Every man commenced running for their war horses, shields, lances, war bonnets. Meantime Kiowas seen them and make run for Scout Creek. Cheyennes made charge towards them. Several Kiowas stayed behind to give cattle so old men and women could dig into sand for breastworks--where Kiowa women and children stayed while the fight went on. One of these Kiowas was awful brave. Cheyennes talk about him to this day. he rode fine white horse, he would charge right in among the Cheyennes. He lanced Man Above, Cheyenne brave off his horse in one of his charges. He held the Cheyennes in check until they shot him off his horse with arrow's in one of his mad charges. When they shot him off his horse balance of the Kiowas ran for their women and children. Old Kiowas at breastworks were ready to fight on foot. Good deal of timber at this place, Kiowas had good many of their best horses tied to trees. Cheyennes captured lots of their horses with their packs onthem--- but could not do much as the Kiowas were in too good place to fight from. Cheyennes left them. Kiowas were on way north to visit the Crows, their old friends to trade for elk-teeth dresses, ermine skins and eagle feathers."" Obviously there is some question as to the exact location of this battle. Grinnell states that the Scout creek name was changed to Kiowa creek after this fight, but it does not agree with Hyde's map or Bent's label. Bent also marked Pawnee Buttes north of Fort Morgan. ""This Butte is where Cheyennes tried to starve the Pawnee war party."" MAP #6 LOCATION OF INDIAN TRAILS. Hyde; ""I sent this sketch map to Bent to get him to locate on it certain places mentioned in his narrative."" Bent marked the trail from Bent's Fort to the village at Sand Creek, and then on to the head of Smoky Hill. The map is one mentioned by Van Male in his first letter to Dr. Willard. Hyde also dated his comments regarding this map. The date of October, 1928, indicates Hydes preparations of the packet prior to the sale. MAP #7 EVENTS DURING THE SUMMER, SPRING AND FALL OF 1864. After a quiet winter, some raiding began along the major roads in April. In one raid on the Platte, a large herd of stock belonging to the Overland Stage Co. was run off from a station east of Julesburg. Lt. George S. Eayre, with 100 men and two howitzers was sent to recover it. On May 16, 1864, he ran onto the village of Black Kettle and Lean Bear who were unaware of the trouble between the whites and the Indians. This is Wolf-Chief's statement many years later (March 28, 1906). ""About 250 lodges of Cheyennes were camped on Ash Creek 60 miles N. of Pawnee Cr. (Note that Bent has the camps on the Smoky Hill) In the morning Cheyenne hunters came in from chasing buffalo Village Cryer went through the camp asking the chiefs to git their horses and go out and meet the soldiers The Cryer said the hunters told him there were good many soldiers and they had cannons with them....Black Kettle and Lean Bear were head chiefs of this village. Lean Eear was leading lot of us to go and meet the soldiers. Just as we rode on hill we seen 4 companies of cavalry and cannon also. Soon as they seen us they formed in line. We were not looking for battle as we had been camped near Ft. Larned all winter and trading with traders....Lean Bear told us all to stay back, that he would ride up and show the officer his Washington papers and show him that they were at peace with the whites. Lean Bear had on his breast Lincoln medal that was given to him in Washington in 1863. When he rode to within 20 or 30 feet, the officer who was in front of the soldiers hallowed out. When the soldiers fired at Lean Bear and Star were both shot off their horses in front of the soldiers. The soldiers rode up and shot them again while lying on the ground. They killed 3 of us and we killed 4 or 5 soldiers. Black Kettle rode up and stopped this fight. He said we were at peace with the whites."" Bent wrote May 6, 1905; ""This caused the outbreak of all the Indians that year. Captain Airs [sic] was cause of the war in 1864."" Lean Bear's band sent the war pipe north to enlist the aid of all the bands in a war on the whites. Some of the peaceful bands went south of the Arkansas River. There was a large village camped on the Solomon or Turkey Cr. during the summer. After Lean Bear's death, plundering along all trails across the middle Plains was massive. Bent wrote (Mar. 15. 1905); ""I seen all kinds of stuff they brought. Fine silks, clocks, bonnets, in fact everything in line of fine dry-goods. They took from trains they plundered. Old Indians wore ladies fine bonnets for hats. I seen fine clocks worn by old men Silks were made into squaw dresses and shirts for young men. I had 1/2 doz. made of same silk. Evans request for a regiment of volunteers was granted in August and recruited by Col. John M. Chivington, Commander of the District of Colorado. They were ready for duty by the first of Sept. Late in August, wrote Bent (Mar. 15, 1905),""Cheyennes and Spotted Tails band of Sioux were camped on the Solomon River and had big council. I was at this council and they got me to write letter that they wanted to talk peace and return two white women they had as prisoners. The letter was taken to the agent at Fort Lyon by two Cheyennes One Eye and Minimick both head men. Maj. Wynkoop came out on Hackberry Creek south of Ft Wallace. I was with the Indians, One Eye and Minimick came with Wynkoop to get their women. The Dog Soldiers wanted to fight Wynkoop. Black Kettle and other chiefs prevented the fight."" Wynkoop then escorted Black Kettle, White Antelope, Dull Knife and four other chiefs to Camp Weld near Denver to meet with Governor Evans and Col. Chivington. Unaware that this meeting was going on, General James J. Blunt took to the field to look for Indians. MAP #8 GEORGE BENT'S MAP OF THE BLUNT ENCOUNTER. In September, 1864, General James G. Blunt's advanced guard, under Col. Scott J. Anthony, encountered a large Cheyenne village moving towards Ft. Larned. At the Advice of his Delaware scouts, Anthony retreated to a hill-top for defense. Gen Blunt, unaware or Anthony's plight, marched up Pawnee Creek looking for Cheyenne bands. Bent Sept. 1905; ""About 40 or 50 Cheyennes that went ahead that morning met Gen. Blunt and shook hands with him. He was riding ahead of his command. these Cheyennes and Blunt did not know that fighting was going on between them and the big village with Maj. Anthony when both parties seen Indians all around Anthony Cheyennes ran to the Creek, Blunt stood there with his troops and did not know what to do for while. He even never fired on those that were running for the Creek. The Indians got behind the Creek bank. Then Blunt with his troops went towards where Anthony was corralled."" The Indians retreated northwest then went to Black Kettle's Village on the Smoky Hill. June 12, 1906; How Red Sleeves Creek got its name. ""My fathers train was camped on this stream in 1848 when 500 Comanches attacked it John Smith and Murphy both claimed that they shot this Comanche Chief off his horse near the wagons. they scalped him--his name was Red Arms or Red Sleeves. Cheyennes knew him, they say he had buckskin coat, the sleeves painted Red. All Indians named the Stream after him"" MAP #9 THE SAND CREEK CAMP AND CHIVINGTON'S ATTACK. This map was drawn by Bent with the help of old Indians. Note the positions of the various bands; the horse herd; Chivington's trail west and east of the camp; the pits dug by the women and old men against the high west bank of the creek; and the lines of soldiers surrounding them. There are two figures; Hyde identified one as White Antelope who refused to fight but stood with his arms folded singing his death song; ""Nothing endures but the earth and the mountains"". The unidentified figure may be where Black Kettle's wife fell while fleeing up the creek-bed. (The following is taken from 'George Bent's Sand Creek'--Afton,nc)"" Black Kettle and some of the chiefs began to move towards Ft. Lyon after their meeting in Denver. Gov. Evans told them that the situation was now out of his hands and they would have to deal with the military, Chivington was ambiguous, stating that he was not the big war chief, but if the Indians went to the military posts and gave up their arms, they would probably be safe. Major Anthony later indicated that they were not to be in the immediate vicinity of Port Lyon. ""Black Kettles band moved towards Arkansas River and got as far as Sand Creek and were camped there for several weeks."" (Morris, 1905) On November 29, 1864, ""Chivington attacked the Village early in Morning I had not got out of bed when I heard soldiers were coming....One company went around East side of the Camp and one Company west side. I looked towards Black Kettle's Lodge and he had Flag on Lodge pole in front of his Lodge. Just than [sic] the soldiers opened fire from all sides of the village. Indians fled up the creek-bed. ""....Old Men and Women dug holes about two miles above the Camp when we got there the soldiers were all around them shooting. two Companies were behind us, of course shooting at us all the way. we pass good many Men Women and Children Killed. I was wounded, just before going into the holes that were dug. these were dug against the bank, this what saved good many Men Women and Children"" (Mar. 15, 1905). Black Kettle and his wife sought safety in the sand pits. As they ran up stream, Medicine Woman Later was felled by a shot. Believing her dead, Black Kettle joined those hiding under the river bank. When darkness fell, Black Kettle found his wife barely alive, having survived nine bullet wounds in her body. He quietly carried her to safety. Bent continued (Dec. 21, 1905), ""At Sand Creek Chivingtons men Stoped [sic] firing at us about 5 o'clock.... soon as they left us we all what was left of us, started up Sand Creek. about half of us in the party were wounded....that night we all stoped in Ravine about 10 Miles above the battle ground.... it was very dark and cold, and those that were not wounded kept up the grass fires as there was no wood to be got to keep from freezing as lots of had no blankets lots of them had their friends to cover them up with grass to keep from freezing that night. some Indians had their ponies picketed in the Village, these Indians raced to the Village on Smokey 50 miles away and told what had taken place....All of us before daylight we all started for the Smoky Hill."" MAP #10 ROUTE AFTER SAND CREEK BATTLE. Hyde; ""This is another map I sent to Bent. He has marked on it the camp after Sand Cr and trail from that camp n-e to the North Smoky Hill, then n-w to Cherry Cr. I made a note on the map asking him if the Cherry Cr marked was the one where the camp was when they went to burn Julesburg; he marked the camp on that stream and wrote a note to tell me this was the creek where they camped. He then continues the trail north from Cherry Cr to the Platte. He should have marked another camp on White Butte between Cherry Cr and the Platte, but was in much doubt as to what stream was White Butte Cr. I think it was Sandy Creek; Grinnell thinks it was Whiteman's Fork. I have been told by ranchers who live in that district today that there is a big white buttes there that can be seen 24 ms away, but these ranchers are dumber than Indians and cannot locate the butte on a map. Bent was in this locality on one occasion and always showed considerable doubt as to the location of Cherry Cr and White Butte Cr."" MAP #11 Hyde's map of General Mitchell's Route. Hyde plotted Gen. Robert B. Mitchell's movements in an attempt to discover why he never encountered Indians who were raiding along the Platte River. MAP #12 FIGHT NEAR MUD SPRINGS, FEBRUARY 1865. Mud Springs provided the only water for wagon trains and stock for some distance along the Overland Trail. A telegraph station was located at the ranch there. Note Indian camp. Bent, April. 24, 1905; After Julesburg, ""Cheyennes, Sioux and some Arapahos were moving for northern country at this time I was with them my brother Charley also. They made raids up and down S Platte. They had battle with 4 Companies on N Platte, About 20 Soldiers made a charge on party of Indians that were shooting at them from the bank of river 300 yds from where the soldiers had corralled their wagons Soldiers could not see these Indians to shoot at them as they were behind bank. The Indians were waiting for the soldiers to move on the road as they had pits throwed up around the corral. Indians behind the bank killed good many horses and mules. Indians behind sand hills make charge on these soldiers and killed 6 soldiers out of 20 one Soldier got away he ran through the Indians and was on roan horse. I seen him as he went through. He ran up the road some Indians got after him but he was on very fast horse that could be seen he threw down saddle bag The Indians brought letters to me that was in this bag. One was for commanding officer at Ft. Laramie to send troops to meet them as there were 1000 of Indians camped on N Platte"" MAP #13 POSITIONS AND MOVEMENTS OF THE SOLDIER SOCIETIES, AT PLATTE BRIDGE. The Southern bands camped and hunted with the Northern Cheyennes, Red Cloud's Sioux and Northern Arapahos all winter. The ill-fated Connors and Cole Expeditions were defeated, and in the spring the ""Cheyennes Arapahoes Siouxs had big council on Tongue River to all agree which would be best place to attack. This was May 1865 after they had selected Platte Bridge...all 3 tribes had Shield Dance...Platte Bridge was to be attacked in middle of summer. By last of May lot of war parties started in different directions toward Platte River to make short raids and get back in time to start for Platte Bridge....After this big war Party was on move, one Society went ahead as advanced guard to keep anybody going ahead. This society picked or selected camping place for the night. there was also one Society at the rear this kept everybody in line while moving. Just before gotten to Platte Bridge the advance guards stoped behind big hill...we all camped behind the hill for the night as there was good camping place.... Everybody kept still. that night, no singing was allowed, Next morning we all moved for the bridge I was with the party that went above the bridge. It was not long before Liet. Casper (Collins) came across the bridge following the road I think he had about 24 men with him"" (Oct 12, 1906), Narrative continued for next map. MAP #14 GEORGE BENT'S MAP 0F BATTLE DRAWN FROM THE POSITION OF THE INDIANS LOOKING SOUTH TO THE BRIDGE. ""Indians came at him from all directions the dust and smoke was so thick I could not see very well. when the dust and smoke cleared away I seen soldiers laying all around. The river was very high. The Indians intended to rush across the river but could not do so on account the river being up. lot of soldiers were on the bridge firing the cannon about 10 Indians crossed the river below the bridge- of course had to swim their horses. They had fight with soldiers on other side. High Wolf or High-backed- Wolf, got killed over there Up the river, we seen train coming so every one made a charge for it When I got there they had corralled the wagons and turned all their animals loose. this was about 2 o'clock Some of the Soldiers layed under the wagons and some in the wagons, all the wagons had covers on, The Soldiers cut holes in the wagon sheets to shoot through. In this pile I counted 22 men killed-8 Indians were killed in this fight....Roman Nose's brother was killed"" (Oct. 12, 1905). COMMENTS: Several enigmas surround the disposition of these maps. Bent's early letters indicate that he and Hyde were collaborating on a history of the Cheyennes. On June 12, 1906, Bent wrote; ""I hope you will find publisher to buy our book soon."" Meanwhile, George Bird Grinnell was also writing to and interviewing Bent. An Oct. 13, 1908 letter states; ""I am in hopes that Grinnell will do something with the book soon. I am glad to hear that he got you to put it in shape for him. Push it through and anything you wish to know write me."" This strongly suggests that Hyde was editing some of Grinnell's work. On Feb. 22, 1912, Bent wrote; ""I don't think Grinnell is doing much writing....He used to ask me good many things to write about...he doesn't do that anymore. ""Yet The Fighting Cheyennes was published in 1915 and Grinnell acknowledged Hyde's background research in his introduction. Why then were the maps not included in this book? Grinnell had a map of Sand Creek similar to Bent's which indicates that he had seen the original. The sale of the maps and letters in the late 1920s is indicative of Hyde's financial status, but why did he fail to keep copies of these maps for the MS he hoped to publish? The Life of George Bent, edited by Lottinville, contains four Bent-Hyde maps and one drawn by Bent showing Cheyenne movements in 1864 and 1865. No credits are given for maps in Grinnell's book, but none appear to be Bent's. I find it difficult to rationalize or answer these questions from Hyde's standpoint. That there were no records remaining of his transactions with VanMale and other dealers forty years after the fact is understandable. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from the obvious intrinsic value of these maps, they should be of interest to scholars in several disciplines. Historians of the American West and the Indian Wars can gain new insights and verify old information. Militaty historians should find them useful in corraborating and augmenting official military reports. If J.W. Vaughn had seen Bent's maps of the Platte Bridge fight, perhaps his search for the place of Lt. Collins' death and the battle of the corralled wagon train would have been easier. The many authors of the Sand Creek affair could have had the original Bent map to work from rather than the Grinnell (1915: 171) map which was not entirely accurate. Bent's map of General Blount's route in his campaign against the Cheyennes has probably never been published. Regardless of its accuracy, it should add to the knowledge of that encounter especially when accompanied by Bent's reports. The maps augment George B. Grinnell's paper (1906:15-22) on Cheyenne names for rivers and streams by locating many geographic places of Indian significance. Bent's letters explain the origin of their Cheyenne names. Used in conjunction with his letters, Bent's maps enhance the ethnographic knowledge of band transhumance, demography and intertribal alliances of the Central Plains Indians. And they provide a better understanding of the pressures of en-forced, rapid change these tribal units were experiencing during the mid 19th Century″ Perhaps the greatest current value is in proto-historic and historic archaeology. Bent locates many summer and winter camp sites, battle grounds, trails and important Indian land-marks. In his letters and on some of his maps, he describes and locates stockades, forts and trading posts built by the Bent brothers. These sites should all be recorded and tested before it is too late.
